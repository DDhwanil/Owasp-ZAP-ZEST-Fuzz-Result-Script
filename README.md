# Owasp-ZAP-ZEST-Fuzz-Result-Script

Using this ZEST script, we can store the result of the Fuzzing responses of the OWASP ZAP.

For that, you have to add this script into the Fuzzer HTTP Processor and add same in Message Processor while configuring your fuzzing logic.

You can modify the response by changing OUTPUT_DIR variable. (i.e here directory is /root/Documents/)
